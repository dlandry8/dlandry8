- 👋 Hi, I’m @dlandry8, but you can call me David.
- 👀 I’m interested in a whole host of things. Programming, electronics, embedded flight software, Jesus, folk & metal music, pro wrestling, and the pleasant anticiplation of living my days with my beautiful Zebra Warrior.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the above things! Focusing on embedded flight software since that's where my career is focused; and Jesus because He's my hope for all eternity. I'd like to learn FPGAs & DSP, having beginner's knowledge of those.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything embedded software related.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just drop me a line at my e-mail address. dlandry@gmx.us.
